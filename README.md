# Bot-lines-
This is the bot lines for 24/7 Casino Discord Bot.


To add your own bot lines to the bot you'd have to use this format.

Each of your bot sayings would have to be put in quotations " " and if there's another line after it you'd have to put a command on the outside of it.

Example: 

"You got your hourly paycheck for being a Math tutor and earned", "This is my new botline", "You get your hourly rate for being cool"

Also
If there's no more bot sayings after your own, you'd not add a comma, a comma is only seperating bot lines.

weekly_list = ["You got your weekly paycheck for being a supporter and earned",
               "You got your weekly paycheck for working at mcdonalds and earned."]
